<strong>Multi-Document Upload</strong>
<p>NHLBI Chat now allows you to upload two documents per chat. The file upload button can now be found in the chat box. Uploaded documents appear under the chat's title in the chat list and can be deleted there.</p>
<strong>New Model Selector</strong>
<p>The model selector is now a button under the text box that displays your active model. Clicking the button provides detailed descriptions of all models available in NHLBI Chat.</p>
<strong>New Model: o3-mini Enabled</strong>
<p>The OpenAI o3-mini model is now available in the model dropdown selector. With training data ending October, 2023 and a 100,000 token context window, o3-mini delivers high accuracy and contextual awareness, making it a powerful option for a wide range of applications. Note that o3-mini does not work with uploaded images. Other documents will work with this model.</p>
